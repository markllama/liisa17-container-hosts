= Container Hosts

This repository contains some simple setup examples for two container hosts:

* ProjectAtomic Atomic Host
* CoreOS Container Linux

The sameplss here are deliberately simple and incomplete. They are meant to be used as a base for learning how to configure and use the container hosts, not as a realistic deployment example.  For more comprehensive examples see the <<demonstors>> below.
