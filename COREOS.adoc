= Boot CoreOS in Vagrant

CoreOS provides a vagrant box setup that initializes `etcd` and
`flannel`.  Unfortunately, in the last 6 months they've also started
an initiative to replae `cloud-init`, their configuration spec
mechanism with `ignition`.  Ignition will be much more featureful, but
it is still a work in progress and they have begun changing the
vagrant setup before it is entirely ready.

To install and run CoreOS in vagrant, revert the git repo to the last
working state with `cloud-init` and then proceed.
----
git clone https://github.com/coreos/coreos-vagrant
cd coreos-vagrant
git checkout dc8dc0efc3629940b9c66ae2afc96057f3287713
cp config.rb.sample config.rb
export NUM_INSTANCES=3
sed -e "s/<token>/$(curl -s https://discovery.etcd.io/new?size=3 | cut -d/ -f4)/" \
  user-data.sample > user-data
vagrant up
â€¦
vagrant ssh core-01
----
Due to the nature of the changes, I did not base a demo on CoreOS/cloud-init. CoreOS will complete the work on Ignition soon and I will revisit it then.
